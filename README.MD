# **Minishell: A Lightweight Bash-like Shell**  

## **Overview**  
Minishell is a custom-built, lightweight shell that replicates essential Bash functionalities, enabling users to execute commands, manage processes, and handle I/O redirection efficiently.  

## **Key Features**  

### **Process Management**  
- Supports running applications as separate child processes using `fork()`.  
- Implements **sequential (`;`) and parallel (`&`) execution** for efficient command processing.  

### **Shell Built-in Commands**  
- **`cd`**: Navigate the file system with relative and absolute paths.  
- **`pwd`**: Display the current directory path.  
- **`exit` / `quit`**: Terminate the shell session.  

### **Environment Variable Support**  
- Allows defining and using environment variables within commands.  
- Supports variable inheritance from the parent shell.  

### **Command Operators**  
- **Piping (`|`)**: Redirects output from one command to another.  
- **Conditional Execution (`&&` / `||`)**: Enables execution chains based on success/failure.  
- **Execution Control (`;` / `&`)**: Runs commands sequentially or in parallel.  

### **I/O Redirection**  
- Redirects input (`<`), output (`>`), and error streams (`2>`, `&>`).  
- Supports **append mode** for output redirection (`>>`, `2>>`).  

## **Implementation Highlights**  
- Uses **`fork()`** for process creation and **`execvp()`** for command execution.  
- Implements **anonymous pipes** for inter-process communication.  
- Utilizes **file descriptors and `dup2()`** for efficient I/O redirection.  

Minishell is a robust, efficient, and user-friendly shell implementation designed for seamless command execution and process management. ðŸš€
